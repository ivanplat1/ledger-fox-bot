fix: update validation labels and restore expense categories

- Change "Тотал" to "Итого" in validation messages for better UX
- Add error handling for missing category column in expenses table
- Restore category logic for expenses: determine category from receipt items
- Restore category breakdown in monthly reports

The category is determined by taking the most frequent category from receipt items.
If the category column is missing in the database, the code will automatically
retry without it to prevent errors.
